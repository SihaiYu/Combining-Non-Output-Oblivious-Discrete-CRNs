Enhancing Reliability of Composed Non-Output-Oblivious Chemical Reaction Networks
============================================================
The ["Composing Non-Output-Oblivious Discrete CRNs"](https://github.com/SihaiYu/Composing-Non-Output-Oblivious-Discrete-CRNs/blob/main/Composing%20Non-Output-Oblivious%20Discrete%20CRNs.zip) file contains the configuration files related to the exploration conducted by Sihai Yu et al. in "Exploration: Computation for Combining Non-Output-Oblivious Discrete Chemical Reaction Networks with a Small Probability of Error".

Download this zip file and upload it to StochSS for simulation and viewing simulation results.

First, log in to StochSS, then click on "Browse your projects".
